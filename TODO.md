# Themis Revamp — TODO

## UI / Styling

- [x] Fix the glitchiness of the Edit Project popup (animation / overlay jank)
- [x] Fix UI issues in the Edit Project and Add/Edit Client popups (layout, spacing)
- [x] Match dropdown colors with the main color theme (active item uses bg-primary)
- [x] Improve visual weight of input fields and dropdowns (borders, focus rings, styling)
- [x] Reduce dropdown list item size to match the rest of the app scale
- [x] Highlight the active/selected item in the sidebar nav
- [x] Fix font color mismatch in the Frameworks detail view
- [x] Fix client name font color mismatch in the Clients list view
- [x] Replace the Controls and Settings sidebar icons with better alternatives
- [x] Enhance the Icons of the client names and avatars across all views

## UI / Styling (Backlog)

- [ ] Fix Frameworks list page — old gray-* classes, no dark mode, cards need redesign to match app style
- [ ] Audit and fix Admin controls page styling (likely same gray-* mismatch)
- [ ] Sidebar collapse chevron should flip direction when sidebar is open/closed
- [ ] Fix "Finalize & Submit Audit" button in project detail — use bg-primary instead of bg-slate-900
- [ ] Fix dashboard project card progress bar — currently hardcoded to 0%
- [ ] Add proper empty state to dashboard when no active projects exist
- [ ] Polish the login page to match the current design system

## Features & Functionality
